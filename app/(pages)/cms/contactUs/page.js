            <div>Being a Noble of an ongoing series is a monthly subscription model which supports the translation as well as the author. In return, Nobles receive access to all currently published chapters of the novel, as well as access to a certain number of unpublished chapters dependent on the subscription tier. Thatâ€™s not all, the entire site will be ad-free for Nobles. Please note that whether you are upgrading, downgrading, beginning, or continuing your Noble subscription, you will be ahead of the latest published chapter by the number of unpublished chapters specified in the description of the tier you subscribe to, and not any other point or number of chapters. Subscriptions last one month and recur automatically. So, if you first subscribe on the 15th, you will next be charged on the 15th day of the following month each month until you unsubscribe or the novel ends.</div>
